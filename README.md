Download the file <code> yt2wav </code> [here](https://github.com/Dmartinez-96/yt2wav/blob/main/macOS/macOS_exe/yt2wav) and save it where you want it. 
Open a terminal by searching "terminal" in the Spotlight Search.

Change the directory to the downloaded file's location with the command:

  <code> cd /path/containing/yt2wav </code>
  
For example, if you saved <code> yt2wav </code> into the directory <code> /Users/username/Downloads </code>, you would input 

  <code> cd /Users/username/Downloads </code>

Replace "<code> username </code>" with whatever your username is if you saved the file to your Downloads folder.

After changing the directory, type the following command and hit enter:

  <code> chmod + x yt2wav </code>

After this, you can go in your file explorer and find where you saved <code> yt2wav </code>.Now when you double click the file, you should be able to open it and run the GUI as normal. This setup process does not need to be repeated generally--just the first time of running the program.
